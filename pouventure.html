    <h2>About The Game</h2>
    <p>Pouventure is a turn based combat game where you play as a girl named Avery.
        The goal of the game is to fight monsters in a random generated dungeon and get to the 
        end to save Pou. 
        <br>
        It features 3 enemies with all different kinds of attacks, 
        a boss fight at the end
        and a random generated dungeon system.

    <h2>My experience</h2>
    <p>This is my first time I made a turn based combat game. 
        I got to learn how to keep track of the player stats and enemy stats.
        I have also created a random dungeon generator in this project.
