    <h2>About This Game</h2>
    <p>Cat Party is a game where you play on a board and you are supposed to collect the yarn ball on the board.
        You can collect fish cookies in minigames after the turn of each player.
        Once every round is over, the player with the most yarn balls, wins.

    <h2>My Experience</h2>
    <p>Cat Party is one of my proudest works. 
        Here is when I practiced making CPU's and have them act as players.
        My goal was to make an engaging board game and have different minigames
        while having the CPU's react accordingly in the minigames.
